## PyAugusta Intermediate Python Skills & Challenges #

Hey everyone, and welcome back to PyAugusta! This month, we'll touch on some intermediate Python topics and try our hand at solving some challenges using our newfound skills.

The topics will include list comprehension, lambda functions, and finally Python Classes and Inheritance. None of them build on the others, so we're a little all over the place. Thats OK though - you can refer back to this repository anytime if you need to take another look.

Enjoy!!!
